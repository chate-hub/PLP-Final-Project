# PLP-Final-Project
#INTRO
This is the final project for the PLP software development course. The project is still in development and is being developed in Django. I originally developed a similar farm management tool in PHP a few months ago, but I wanted to see if I could develop it using the tools I learned at PLP. I plan to launch an app as well.
